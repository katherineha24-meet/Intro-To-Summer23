  Ferrets are playful and curious small mammals known for their sleek bodies and mischievous personalities. They are domesticated descendants of European polecats and belong to the same family as weasels and otters. With a keen sense of smell and agile movements, ferrets are adept hunters and explorers, often forming strong bonds with their human companions. Their playful antics and affectionate nature make them popular pets in many households around the world. </p>
